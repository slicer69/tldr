<h2> comm</h2><br>
<b>Description:</b> <b>Select or reject lines common to two files. Both files must be sorted.</b><br><br>
- Produce three tab-separated columns: lines only in first file, lines only in second file and common lines:

<blockquote>comm {{file1}} {{file2}}</blockquote>
- Print only lines common to both files:

<blockquote>comm -12 {{file1}} {{file2}}</blockquote>
- Print only lines common to both files, reading one file from stdin:

<blockquote>cat {{file1}} | comm -12 - {{file2}}</blockquote>
- Get lines only found in first file, saving the result to a third file:

<blockquote>comm -23 {{file1}} {{file2}} > {{file1_only}}</blockquote>
- Print lines only found in second file, when the files aren't sorted:

<blockquote>comm -13 <(sort {{file1}}) <(sort {{file2}})</blockquote>
