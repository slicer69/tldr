<b>comm</b><br><br>
<b>Select or reject lines common to two files. Both files must be sorted.</b><br><br>
- Produce three tab-separated columns: lines only in first file, lines only in second file and common lines:

<blockquote>comm <i>file1</i> <i>file2</i></blockquote>
- Print only lines common to both files:

<blockquote>comm -12 <i>file1</i> <i>file2</i></blockquote>
- Print only lines common to both files, reading one file from `stdin`:

<blockquote>cat <i>file1</i> | comm -12 - <i>file2</i></blockquote>
- Get lines only found in first file, saving the result to a third file:

<blockquote>comm -23 <i>file1</i> <i>file2</i> > <i>file1_only</i></blockquote>
- Print lines only found in second file, when the files aren't sorted:

<blockquote>comm -13 <(sort <i>file1</i>) <(sort <i>file2</i>)</blockquote>
