<h2> file</h2><br>
<b>Description:</b> <b>Determine file type.</b><br><br>
- Give a description of the type of the specified file.  Works fine for files with no file extension:

<blockquote>file {{filename}}</blockquote>
- Look inside a zipped file and determine the file type(s) inside:

<blockquote>file -z {{foo.zip}}</blockquote>
- Allow file to work with special or device files:

<blockquote>file -s {{filename}}</blockquote>
- Don't stop at first file type match; keep going until the end of the file:

<blockquote>file -k {{filename}}</blockquote>
