<blockquote>patch <i>path/to/file</i> < <i>patch.diff</i></blockquote>
- Patch a file writing the result to a different file:

<blockquote>patch <i>path/to/input_file</i> -o <i>path/to/output_file</i> < <i>patch.diff</i></blockquote>
- Apply a patch to the current directory:

<blockquote>patch -p1 < <i>patch.diff</i></blockquote>
- Apply the reverse of a patch:

<blockquote>patch -R < <i>patch.diff</i></blockquote>
