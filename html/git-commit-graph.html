- Write a commit-graph file for the packed commits in the repository's local `.git` directory:

<blockquote>git commit-graph write</blockquote>
- Write a commit-graph file containing all reachable commits:

<blockquote>git show-ref --hash | git commit-graph write --stdin-commits</blockquote>
- Write a commit-graph file containing all commits in the current commit-graph file along with those reachable from `HEAD`:

<blockquote>git rev-parse <i>HEAD</i> | git commit-graph write --stdin-commits --append</blockquote>
