<b>umount</b><br><br>
<b>Unlink a filesystem from its mount point, making it no longer accessible.</b><br><br><b>A filesystem cannot be unmounted when it is busy.</b><br><br>
- Unmount a filesystem, by passing the path to the source it is mounted from:

<blockquote>umount <i>path/to/device_file</i></blockquote>
- Unmount a filesystem, by passing the path to the target where it is mounted:

<blockquote>umount <i>path/to/mounted_directory</i></blockquote>
- Unmount all mounted filesystems (except the `proc` filesystem):

<blockquote>umount -a</blockquote>
