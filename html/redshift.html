<b>Description:</b> <b>Adjust the color temperature of your screen according to your surroundings.</b><br><br>
- Turn on Redshift with 5700K temperature during day and 3600K at night:

<blockquote>redshift -t {{5700}}:{{3600}}</blockquote>
- Turn on Redshift with a manually-specified custom location:

<blockquote>redshift -l {{latitude}}:{{longitude}}</blockquote>
- Turn on Redshift with 70% screen brightness during day and 40% brightness at night:

<blockquote>redshift -b {{0.7}}:{{0.4}}</blockquote>
- Turn on Redshift with custom gamma levels (between 0 and 1):

<blockquote>redshift -g {{red}}:{{green}}:{{blue}}</blockquote>
- Turn on Redshift with a constant unchanging color temperature:

<blockquote>redshift -O {{temperature}}</blockquote>
