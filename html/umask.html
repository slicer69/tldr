<h2> umask</h2><br>
<b>Manage the read/write/execute permissions that are masked out (i.e. restricted) for newly created files by the user.</b><br><br>
- Display the current mask in octal notation:

<blockquote>umask</blockquote>
- Display the current mask in symbolic (human-readable) mode:

<blockquote>umask -S</blockquote>
- Change the mask symbolically to allow read permission for all users (the rest of the mask bits are unchanged):

<blockquote>umask <i>a+r</i></blockquote>
- Set the mask (using octal) to restrict no permissions for the file's owner, and restrict all permissions for everyone else:

<blockquote>umask <i>077</i></blockquote>
