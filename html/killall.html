<b>killall</b><br><br>
<b>Send kill signal to all instances of a process by name.</b><br><br><b>All signals except SIGKILL and SIGSTOP can be intercepted by the process, allowing a clean exit.</b><br><br>
- Terminate a process using the default SIGTERM (terminate) signal:

<blockquote>killall <i>process_name</i></blockquote>
- List available signal names (to be used without the 'SIG' prefix):

<blockquote>killall -l</blockquote>
- Interactively ask for confirmation before termination:

<blockquote>killall -i <i>process_name</i></blockquote>
- Terminate a process using the SIGING (interrupt) signal, which is the same signal sent by pressing `Ctrl+C`:

<blockquote>killall -INT <i>process_name</i></blockquote>
- Immediately kill a process (signal cannot be intercepted so it's not a clean exit):

<blockquote>killall -KILL <i>process_name</i></blockquote>
