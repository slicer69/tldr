<h2> yum</h2><br>
<b>Package management utility for RHEL, Feodra, and CentOS (for older versions).</b><br><br>
- Synchronize list of packages and versions available. This should be run first, before running subsequent yum commands:

<blockquote>yum update</blockquote>
- Install a new package:

<blockquote>yum install <i>package</i></blockquote>
- Install a new package and assume yes to all questions (also works with update, great for automated updates):

<blockquote>yum -y install <i>package</i></blockquote>
- Find the package that provides a particular command:

<blockquote>yum provides <i>command</i></blockquote>
- Remove a package:

<blockquote>yum remove <i>package</i></blockquote>
- Upgrade installed packages to newest available versions:

<blockquote>yum upgrade</blockquote>
