<b>git bisect</b><br><br>
<b>Use binary search to find the commit that introduced a bug.</b><br><br><b>Git automatically jumps back and forth in the commit graph to progressively narrow down the faulty commit.</b><br><br><b>More information: <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect">home page</a></b><br><br>
- Start a bisect session on a commit range bounded by a known buggy commit, and a known clean (typically older) one:

<blockquote>git bisect start <i>bad_commit</i> <i>good_commit</i></blockquote>
- For each commit that `git bisect` selects, mark it as "bad" or "good" after testing it for the issue:

<blockquote>git bisect <i>good|bad</i></blockquote>
- After `git bisect` pinpoints the faulty commit, end the bisect session and return to the previous branch:

<blockquote>git bisect reset</blockquote>
- Skip a commit during a bisect (e.g. one that fails the tests due to a different issue):

<blockquote>git bisect skip</blockquote>
