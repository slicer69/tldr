<h2> kill</h2><br>
<b>Description:</b> <b>Sends a signal to a process, usually related to stopping the process.</b><br><br><b>Description:</b> <b>All signals except for SIGKILL and SIGSTOP can be intercepted by the process to perform a clean exit.</b><br><br>
- Terminate a program using the default SIGTERM (terminate) signal:

<blockquote>kill {{process_id}}</blockquote>
- List available signal names (to be used without the `SIG` prefix):

<blockquote>kill -l</blockquote>
- Terminate a program using the SIGHUP (hang up) signal. Many daemons will reload instead of terminating:

<blockquote>kill -{{1|HUP}} {{process_id}}</blockquote>
- Terminate a program using the SIGINT (interrupt) signal. This is typically initiated by the user pressing `Ctrl+C`:

<blockquote>kill -{{2|INT}} {{process_id}}</blockquote>
- Signal the operating system to immediately terminate a program (which gets no chance to capture the signal):

<blockquote>kill -{{9|KILL}} {{process_id}}</blockquote>
- Signal the operating system to pause a program, it until a SIGCONT ("continue") signal is received:

<blockquote>kill -{{17|STOP}} {{process_id}}</blockquote>
