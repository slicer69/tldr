<b>Kakoune is a mode-based code editor implementing the "multiple selections" paradigm.</b><br><br><b>Data can be selected and simultaneously edited in different locations, using multiple selections; users can also connect to the same session for collaborative editing.</b><br><br>
- Open a file and enter normal mode, to execute commands:

<blockquote>kak <i>path/to/file</i></blockquote>
- Enter insert mode from normal mode, to write text into the file:

<blockquote>i</blockquote>
- Escape insert mode, to go back to normal mode:

<blockquote><Escape></blockquote>
- Replace all instances of "foo" in the current file with "bar":

<blockquote>%s<i>foo</i><Enter>c<i>bar</i><Escape></blockquote>
- Un-select all secondary selections, and keep only the main one:

<blockquote><Space></blockquote>
- Search for numbers and select the first two:

<blockquote>/\d+<Enter>N</blockquote>
- Insert the contents of a file:

<blockquote>!cat <i>path/to/file</i><Enter></blockquote>
- Save the current file:
