<h2> hub</h2><br>
<b>A wrapper for git that adds commands for working with github-based projects.</b><br><br><b>The commands can also be used using "git" instead of "hub".</b><br><br>
- Clone a repository you own, using just the repository name rather than the full URL:

<blockquote>hub clone <i>repo_name</i></blockquote>
- Clone another user's repository, using their github username and the repository name:

<blockquote>hub clone <i>username</i>/<i>repo_name</i></blockquote>
- Create a fork of the current repository (cloned from another user) under your github profile:

<blockquote>hub fork</blockquote>
- Create a PR of the current branch in the original repository (after pushing the branch to github):

<blockquote>hub pull-request</blockquote>
- Upload the current (local-only) repository to your github account:

<blockquote>hub create</blockquote>
