<b>git reset</b><br><br>
<b>Undo commits or unstage changes, by resetting the current git HEAD to the specified state.</b><br><br><b>If a path is passed, it works as "unstage"; if a commit hash or branch is passed, it works as "uncommit".</b><br><br>
- Unstage everything:

<blockquote>git reset</blockquote>
- Unstage specific file(s):

<blockquote>git reset <i>path/to/file(s)</i></blockquote>
- Unstage portions of a file:

<blockquote>git reset -p <i>path/to/file</i></blockquote>
- Undo the last commit, keeping its changes (and any further uncommitted changes) in the filesystem:

<blockquote>git reset HEAD~</blockquote>
- Undo the last two commits, adding their changes to the index, i.e. staged for commit:

<blockquote>git reset --soft HEAD~2</blockquote>
- Reset the repository to a given commit, discarding committed, staged and uncommitted changes since then:

<blockquote>git reset --hard <i>commit</i></blockquote>
