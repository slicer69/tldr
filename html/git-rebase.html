<b>git rebase</b><br><br>
<b>Apply local commits on top of another branch's history.</b><br><br><b>This effectively "moves" an entire branch to another base, by creating copies of the commits in the new location.</b><br><br>
- Rebase the current branch on top of the master branch:

<blockquote>git rebase master</blockquote>
- Start an interactive rebase, which allows the commits to be reordered, omitted, combined or modified:

<blockquote>git rebase -i <i>target_base_branch</i></blockquote>
- Continue a rebase that was interrupted by a merge failure, after editing conflicting files:

<blockquote>git rebase --continue</blockquote>
- Abort a rebase in progress (e.g. if it is interrupted by a merge conflict):

<blockquote>git rebase --abort</blockquote>
- Rebase a branch starting from a specific base commit, rather than the common ancestor shared with the target branch:

<blockquote>git rebase --onto <i>new_base_commit</i> <i>old_base_commit</i></blockquote>
