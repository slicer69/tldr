<b>cmake</b><br><br>
<b>CMake is a cross-platform build system generator.</b><br><br>
Make a project in the same directory as the source:

<blockquote>
<br>cmake
<br>make
<br></blockquote>
Make a project in a subdirectory, required for some projects:

<blockquote>
<br>mkdir build
<br>cd build
<br>cmake ../
<br>make
<br></blockquote>
To run cmake in interactive mode (It will ask you for each variable, 
instead of relying on defaults):

<blockquote>cmake -i</blockquote>
