<b>Find filenames quickly.</b><br><br>
- Look for pattern in the database. Note: the database is recomputed periodically (usually weekly or daily):

<blockquote>locate <i>pattern</i></blockquote>
- Look for a file by its exact filename (a pattern containing no globbing characters is interpreted as `*pattern*`):

<blockquote>locate */<i>filename</i></blockquote>
- Recompute the database. You need to do it if you want to find recently added files:

<blockquote>sudo updatedb</blockquote>
