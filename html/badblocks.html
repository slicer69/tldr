<b>badblocks</b><br><br>
<b>Search a device for bad blocks.</b><br><br><b>Some usages of badblocks can cause destructive actions, such as erasing all the data on a disk, including the partition table.</b><br><br>
- Search a disk for bad blocks by using a non-destructive read-only test:

<blockquote>sudo badblocks <i>/dev/sda</i></blockquote>
- Search an unmounted disk for bad blocks with a non-destructive read-write test:

<blockquote>sudo badblocks -n <i>/dev/sda</i></blockquote>
- Search an unmounted disk for bad blocks with a destructive write test:

<blockquote>sudo badblocks -w <i>/dev/sda</i></blockquote>
- Search an unmounted disk for bad blocks with a destructive write test and show verbose status:

<blockquote>sudo badblocks -svw <i>/dev/sda</i></blockquote>
- Search an unmounted disk in desctructive mode and output found blocks to a file:

<blockquote>sudo badblocks -o <i>/path/to/file</i> -w <i>/dev/sda</i></blockquote>
- Search an unmounted disk in desctructive mode with improved speed using 4K block size and 64K block count:

<blockquote>sudo badblocks -w -b <i>4096</i> -c <i>65536</i> <i>/dev/sda</i></blockquote>
